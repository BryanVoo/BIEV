                                                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                                                <p>The Pfizer vaccine, also known as the Pfizer-BioNTech Vaccine is a vaccine that was a collaborative effort by the German company BioNTech. A clinical trial demonstrated that the vaccine has an efficacy rate of 95 percent in preventing Covid-19. </p>
                                                <img src="images/pfizer_main.jpg" alt="Pfizer Vaccine" class="card-img-top img-fluid p-0 bg-primary card-img-orig d-none d-md-block rounded-0"> <br>
                                                <h4>How does it work?</h4>
                                                <p>The SARS-CoV-2 virus is studded with proteins that it uses to enter human cells. These so-called spike proteins make a tempting target for potential vaccines and treatments. Like the Moderna vaccine, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is based on the virus’s genetic instructions for building the spike protein.</p>
                                                <img src ="images/pfizer_mrna.png" alt="lipids surrounding the mRNA" class="card-img-top img-fluid p-0 bg-primary card-img-orig d-none d-md-block rounded-0">
                                                <p>The vaccine uses messenger RNA, genetic material that our cells read to make proteins. The molecule — called mRNA for short — is fragile and would be chopped to pieces by our natural enzymes if it were injected directly into the body. To protect their vaccine, Pfizer and BioNTech wrap the mRNA in oily bubbles made of lipid nanoparticles.</p> <br>
                                                <h4>Who can take it?</h4>
                                                <p>Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is authorized and recommended for people 16 years of age and older.</p>
                                                <p>The recommendation for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine should be implemented in conjunction with the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices’ (ACIP) <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm695152e2.htm">interim recommendations for allocation of COVID-19 vaccine</a>. You may also consider <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/phased-implementation.html">sub-prioritization among recommended populations.</a></p>
                                                <p>The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine requires two injections, given 21 days apart, to prime the immune system well enough to fight off the coronavirus. But because the vaccine is so new, researchers don’t know how long its protection might last.</p>
                                                <p>You should administer the second dose as close as possible to the recommended interval of 21 days after dose 1. However, if it is not possible to follow the recommended interval, you may schedule the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for administration up to 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose. There are currently limited data on efficacy of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines administered beyond this window. If the second dose is administered after these intervals, there is no need to restart the series.</p> <br>
                                                <h4>Preparation and Injection</h4>
                                                <p>Each vial of the vaccine contains 5 doses of 0.3 milliliters. The vaccine must be thawed before injection and diluted with saline. After dilution the vial must be used within six hours.</p>

                                        <p>There will be some side effects when injected with the vaccine which lasts several days.
